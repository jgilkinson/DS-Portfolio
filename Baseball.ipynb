The 0.58 correlation is considered the upper end of the Moderate Correlation chart. T-shirts a distant second place with only a very weak correlation, firework displays are another very weak correlation and also they cost the same regardless of attendees. If there is 100 or 10,000 the show costs the same. Finally, baseball caps actually appear to have a negative correlation however this could be due to a limited sample size, but it is something to consider. "

I had thought location might matter, other California teams, but the Padres and Giants have very weak correlations. Only the Angels have a slightly weak correlation and are based near the Dodgers. Alternatively, I went online to discover records from 2022 to see if ranking could have a factor. Both the Mets and the Braves had a win pct of .623 and the Mets had the best positive correlation and the Braves had the best Negative correlation. It should be noted the Dodgers had a win pct of .685, better than both teams, so it is unclear based on this data why people actively avoided the Braves and went to see the Mets. "
